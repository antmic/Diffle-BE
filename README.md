This is a simple web server for a custom Polish implementation of the Diffle game.
The server responds to two requests:

1. a /getword GET request with a random word selected from a list of winning words;
2. a /checkword POST request with a true/false message depending on whether the word sent in the request is in the dictionary.

You can try the game at https://antmic.github.io/Diffly/
